/**
 *class represents an abstract mechanism for data integrity management. 
 * <p>Every action Performed on collections (after initialisation) is passed 
 * through this mechanism. 
 * <p>Through Appropriate implementations have the ability programmer to set 
 * priorities for specific action (for example, When We decide to set priority 
 * to invoke events for the selected node), to filter out certain requests or 
 * queuing of events to their calling in the order given.
 * <p>Class methods are divided into 3 categories:
 * <p>- first category provide a set of  communication method between 
 * CoreAlgorith and ConsistencyManager (they are used primarily to transmit 
 * received messages), they include:
 * <p>{@link AbstractConsistencyManager#indicationReceived(JCsyncAbstractOperation) indicationReceived} 
 * <br>{@link AbstractConsistencyManager#requestReceived(pl.edu.pjwstk.mteam.pubsub.message.request.PublishRequest, pl.edu.pjwstk.mteam.jcsync.operation.JCsyncAbstractOperation) requestReceived} 
 * <br>{@link AbstractConsistencyManager#responseReceived(pl.edu.pjwstk.mteam.jcsync.operation.JCsyncAbstractOperation, short) responseReceived}
 * <br>{@link AbstractConsistencyManager#registerObject(java.lang.String) registerObject}
 * <br>{@link AbstractConsistencyManager#setCoreAlgorith(pl.edu.pjwstk.mteam.jcsync.core.JCsyncAlgorithInterface) setCoreAlgorith}
 * <br><p>- second provide a mechanism for communication between 
 * JCSyncAbstractSharedObject (and its derivatives) and ConsistencyManager. 
 * That can be used for example to suspend the worker threads until a response 
 * and/or indication is received . These are:
 * <p>{@link AbstractConsistencyManager#beforeRequestSend(pl.edu.pjwstk.mteam.jcsync.operation.JCsyncAbstractOperation, boolean) beforeRequestSend}
 * <br>{@link AbstractConsistencyManager#afterRequestSend(pl.edu.pjwstk.mteam.jcsync.operation.JCsyncAbstractOperation, boolean) afterRequestSend}
 * <p>- the third category is a set of internal methods for better transparency 
 * of the implementation:
 * <p>{@link AbstractConsistencyManager#invoke(pl.edu.pjwstk.mteam.jcsync.core.JCSyncAbstractSharedObject, pl.edu.pjwstk.mteam.jcsync.operation.MethodCarrier) invoke}
 *
