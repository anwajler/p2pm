1. Where to start P2PPManager in J2ME?
2. Do we have to use UDP or TCP, or maybe both at the same time?
3. If an answer for Q2 is that we can have both at the same time, then how to 
    determine which transport should be used for join() and other API methods? 
    There's also a PeerInfo object that contains info about a port, so it has to 
    know which port to use.
4. Enroll and Authenticate messages have "Certificate-Sign-Request". What's
